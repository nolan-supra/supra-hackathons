# Supra // Hackathon @ Permissionless IV // Hackathon Challenges

These challenges are designed to push the boundaries of what’s possible with on-chain automation, intelligent agents, and ecosystem tooling—built entirely on Supra's Layer 1 Move network.

## Challenge 1: On-Chain Automation Unleashed

Supra’s automation framework is integrated directly into the execution layer, enabling smart contracts to autonomously execute logic at the end of every block without external triggers. We're challenging builders to explore novel use cases that showcase the power of block-by-block automation.

**Project Ideas (Not limited to):**
- **Decentralized DCA Engine**: Users deposit funds and define strategies to DCA into a token at defined intervals—powered entirely by Supra automation.
- **Subscription-Based Services**: Time-based subscription smart contracts that auto-renew or expire using on-chain scheduling.
- **Automated Liquidation Bot**: A DeFi protocol with built-in liquidation logic using Supra automation—eliminates the need for external keepers.
- **NFT Rental System**: Smart contracts that automatically return NFTs after rental duration ends.
- **On-Chain Loyalty/Reward Distribution**: Periodic reward drop system for token holders using auto-executed scripts.
- **Yield Optimizer Across Lending Protocols**: Automate yield rebalancing between lending platforms using Supra scripts for yield fluctuation simulations.

## Challenge 2: AI Agents + Supra: Smarter Contracts

Explore how AI agents can interact with Supra's on-chain logic. This could mean building AI-enhanced apps that read Supra data feeds or build self-improving protocols using VRF, price feeds, or automation. We're especially excited by AI agents that interact with smart contracts intelligently or make decisions based on market conditions using on-chain/off-chain hybrid setups.

**Project Ideas (Not limited to):**
- **On-Chain Auto-Trading Agent**: An AI agent that consumes Supra price feeds and makes real-time trades using predefined goals.
- **VRF-Powered Game AI**: Games or dApps that use Supra VRF to introduce provable randomness for AI decision-making.
- **Auto-DAO Proposal Generator**: An AI tool that monitors DAO performance and generates proposals based on heuristics (e.g., treasury usage, vote activity).
- **AI-Powered Risk Monitor**: AI agent watching asset price feeds and liquidity events, flagging or acting on DeFi protocol risk.
- **Auto-Orchestrator**: AI agent that coordinates Supra automation jobs based on evolving user intents or gas costs.
- **Sentiment Analysis & AI-Powered Trading Signals**: Implement AI-based insights for optimal entry/exit points, leveraging price action and Supra’s oracle feeds.

## Challenge 3: Build the Supra Stack

Supra is building out its ecosystem—help us accelerate that by building essential infrastructure. This track is for developers who want to make life easier for other developers. Whether you’re writing an SDK, building a custom indexer, or creating analytics dashboards, this is your chance to shape the core developer experience on Supra.

**Project Ideas (Not limited to):**
- **Typescript/Javascript SDK**: Easy-to-use SDK for Supra smart contract interactions with examples.
- **Automation Job Dashboard**: Visual UI to browse, create, and debug automation tasks (like a cron job explorer).
- **Move Contract Debugger or Playground**: Web-based IDE with contract execution and step-through capabilities.
- **Supra Data Indexer**: Lightweight tool to index Supra blockchain events, with GraphQL or REST API exposure.
- **Explorer Plugin**: Open-source widget or plugin that adds new data visualizations to the Supra block explorer.
- **StarKey Wallet Integration Library**: A polished frontend library (React/Next.js) that wraps the StarKey wallet API, offering pre-built hooks, UI components, network switching, transaction signing, and developer-friendly abstractions to simplify wallet onboarding.
