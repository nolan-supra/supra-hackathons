# Supra // Hackathon @ Permissionless IV // Official Submission Guidelines

To ensure a fair and impactful competition, all participating teams must meet the following **mandatory** submission requirements. Please read carefully as **non-compliance will result in disqualification**.

## Summary

To be eligible for judging, your project must:

1. **Integrate with the Supra stack**

2. **Provide project/team documentation**

3. **Provide a functional demo with UI/UX considerations**

4. **Provide a video walkthrough**

5. **Open source all submission code/efforts**


**All requirements must be included within a public GitHub repository.**

##  Network & Core Infrastructure Usage

Each submission must integrate with Supra's stack.

-  Integrate with **Supra's L1 Move Network**
-  Integrate with **Supra-native services** (if needed):
   - [**Data Feeds**](https://docs.supra.com/oracles)
   - [**Verifiable Random Function (dVRF)** ](https://docs.supra.com/oracles/dvrf)
   - [**Automation**](https://docs.supra.com/automation)
   - [**SupraNova Bridge**](https://docs.supra.com/supranova)
- Integrate with [**StarKey Wallet**](https://starkey.app/) (if needed)

> Project's that do not use Supra's network, fail to utilize its native services when clearly required (e.g., using off-chain oracles or external automation), or do not integrate with StarKey wallet when clearly required, will be **disqualified**.


##  Project Documentation

Each submission must include a well-structured **project document** as part of your repository. This document should cover:

1. **Team Introduction**
   - Name(s) of participants
   - Roles and responsibilities
   - Links to GitHub, LinkedIn, or other relevant profiles

2. **Problem Statement & Solution**
   - What industry problem does this solve?
   - Why is your solution meaningful?

3. **Development Challenges**
   - What obstacles did your team encounter?
   - How did you overcome them?

4. **Project Overview**
   - Concise description of your dApp or tool
   - Summary of functionality and features

5. **Design Diagrams**
   - Architecture, flowcharts, or system diagrams that illustrate how the system works

6. **Technical Breakdown**
   - Technologies used (languages, frameworks, libraries)
   - Key modules, APIs, or protocol interactions

> Incomplete or missing documentation will result in **disqualification**.


##  Functional Demo

A working demonstration of your project is required. This demo must be:

-  **Hosted in a public GitHub repository**
-  **Accompanied by clear, step-by-step instructions** for setup and usage
-  Must show **active interaction** with at least one Supra service (e.g., fetching oracle data, scheduling automation, or using randomness)

Please note that hosted demos are preferred, although not required. [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) is often an easy and lightweight way to host your demos for the duration of judging.

> Passive integrations or placeholder interactions (e.g., fetching data without using it) do **not** qualify as valid usage.


##  UI/UX Standards

A smooth and usable interface makes your project more impactful. All submissions must demonstrate attention to **design and user experience**, including:

-  **Clear navigation** with a working interface (no broken or placeholder buttons)
-  **Action feedback** for all user interactions (e.g., transaction success/failure, loading states)
-  **Responsive layout** (if applicable) for different screen sizes
-  **Seamless wallet integration**  especially StarKey
-  **Intuitive UX** for interacting with Supra features (automation jobs, randomness events, data usage, etc.)

**Bonus points** may be awarded for:
- Use of clean UI libraries like **TailwindCSS**, **ShadCN**, or **Chakra UI**
- Consistent visual theme and polished look-and-feel

> Incomplete or low-effort UX may result in **point deductions** during judging.


##  Video Walkthrough

Your submission must include a **short video** that clearly walks through the project. The video should:

-  Introduce your **team members**
-  Explain your **project's purpose and architecture**
-  Walk through the **live demo**, showing real interactions with Supra services
-  Stay **under 5 minutes** when possible

> Videos that are missing, unclear, or do not show interaction with Supra's stack will result in **disqualification**.


##  Open Source Code

To support transparency and community growth, your full project must be open source:

-  All project code (backend, frontend, automation, etc.) must be in **public repositories**
-  Code must include **comments and basic documentation**
-  Organize folders and files logically for easy navigation

> Submissions without open source code, or with undocumented code, will not be considered.


##  Submission Deadline & Support

All submissions must be received **before the official hackathon deadline**.  

Commits after the submission deadline will be ignored.

Late entries will **not** be accepted under any circumstances.

**All requirements must be included within a public GitHub repository.**

If you have any questions or need support, reach out to the **Supra team** on-site or via our official [Discord](https://discord.gg/supralabs).

##  Final Tips

To maximize your chances of success:
- Focus on real use cases enabled **only** by Supra's stack
- Make your demo **easy to run**
- Prioritize **clarity, creativity, and execution**

Good luck! We're excited to see what you build on Supra!
